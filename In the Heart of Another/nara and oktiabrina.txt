Nara’s and Oktiabrina’s Stories
Nara Movsesian was born in Erevan, the capital of Armenia, on April 17, 1958. Before coming to
the United States, Nara was a Russian language and literature teacher for fourteen years. She
came to the United States on May 28, 1992, following her husband Souren, who had arrived a
year earlier.
Initially, Souren was very excited about the many changes that took place in Armenia after the
country declared its independence from the Soviet Union. But when he saw that the new
bureaucracy and government were becoming too corrupt, and that any resistance to the system
was becoming dangerous, he felt he had no choice but to leave.
Nara’s mother, Oktiabrina, and father, Rafik, joined Nara in 1993.
Here are Nara’s and Oktiabrina’s stories.
Historical Note
The Armenian people have a long and painful history. At various times, they have suffered
invasions by Romans, Persians, Byzantines, Mongols, Arabs, and Ottoman Turks. The saddest
chapter in their history occurred between 1915 and 1922 at the hands of the Ottoman Empire
and is known as the Armenian Genocide.
On April 24, 1915, the ruling political party within the Ottoman state (present-day Turkey), the
Committee for Union and Progress, began a program of ethnic cleansing against their Armenian
neighbors. Fueled by a racist-nationalist ideology, the Young Turks, as they were called,
eventually slaughtered over one and a half million Armenian people. Despite continued
international pressure and overwhelming historical proof, Turkey has to this day failed to
recognize the fact of the Armenian Genocide.
The genocide created a diaspora (Greek for “scattering of seeds”), forcing millions of Armenians
to settle in Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.
After Turkey was defeated in World War I, Armenia claimed its independence on May 28, 1918,
but this independence lasted only two years. In 1920, the country was annexed by the Soviet
Union. Two years later, the Soviets placed Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan into what was
called the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Erevan has been the capital of Armenia since the country gained independence in 1918. Today
it is the largest city in the country, with a population of over one million.
My Mother’s FamilyMy grandmother, Lusik Osmanian, was born in the city of Izmir, Turkey, in 1903. During World
War I, she escaped with her grandmother Ovsanna to Nakhichevan, a city in the Russian part of
Armenia. Her parents stayed in Izmir, and she never saw them again.
When my grandmother was thirteen, the family arranged a marriage for her to an
eighteen-year-old Armenian boy. He was tall, handsome, and very masculine, but my
grandmother was shy, and whenever her new husband tried to talk to her, she would hide
behind her mother-in-law.
World War I was still in progress when her husband left to serve in the army. This was a difficult
time for my grandmother. While he was gone, she developed typhus and was hospitalized for a
long time. With nowhere else to go, she returned to live with her mother-in-law, who viewed her
as just another mouth to feed in a time of hunger.
One winter day, while trying to keep warm, my grandmother accidentally caught her feet in a
tandir (a large hole in the ground used for baking) and burned her legs so badly that she had to
spend another year in the hospital.
Her husband never came back from the war, and she never learned what happened to him.
When my grandmother was twenty-four, her relatives took her to live in Erevan, where she met
my grandfather, Pogos Osmanian, who was twenty years older. He was fifty years old when my
mother, Oktiabrina, was born.
My mother tells me that my grandmother was an angel. The neighbors adored her and always
came to ask for her advice. She was trusting, with a child’s innocence. People used to say,
“If
you give her a stone, you can take bread from her.
” When she passed away, everyone cried.
I didn’t know my mother’s father because he died when I was one year old. I know that he was
born in 1880 in the city of Shamakhi, which is currently in the territory of Azerbaijan. When he
was older, he moved to Baku and became involved in the Bolshevik Revolution.
Historical Note
The Bolshevik Revolution, also known as the October Revolution, took place in Russia on
October 25, 1917, and was followed by a civil war that created the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, or Soviet Union, in 1922. The Bolsheviks were a political party founded by Vladimir
Lenin, who became the first head of the Soviet Union and the originator of Leninism, a branch of
Marxist communist theory.
Leon Trotsky, a comrade of Lenin, was a fellow leader of the October Revolution. After Lenin’s
death, Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party for leading the Left Opposition, which
opposed Joseph Stalin’s rise to power. Trotsky was eventually assassinated by Stalinist agents
in Mexico. His political theories are known as Trotskyism, and his followers as Trotskyites.My grandfather was deeply dedicated to the high ideals and morals of the revolution. Like many
communist families, he gave his children “red baptism” names:
— Oktiabrina (after the October Revolution)
— Karlen (Karl Marx + Lenin)
— Lena (Lenin)
— Vladimir (Vladimir Lenin)
— Robert (after a German revolutionary named Robert)
My grandfather was sent to Krasnodar to manage a large factory where money was printed.
Everyone was checked for stolen cash when they left the factory each day, but nobody checked
my grandfather because of his impeccable reputation for honesty.
In 1937, my grandfather was accused of being a Trotskyite and taken to jail. This was very
difficult for the family. Since my grandmother was a housewife and the children were still young,
they relied on him for their livelihood. Everyone at his work was shocked by the arrest because
they knew how dedicated he was to the Communist Party. Many went to the Central Committee
to speak on his behalf.
“How can you accuse him?” they said.
He was released after two months, when the uncle of one of his supporters—who was the judge
of the city—told the authorities that my grandfather had been falsely accused.
My grandfather was so physically and emotionally broken by the arrest and imprisonment that
he left his Communist Party membership card on the table of the communist authorities. The
party secretary tried to talk him out of resigning, but he told them:
“After all I have done for the party, you have offended me. Now I see what is going on, and I will
never sit at the same table with these corrupt people. These are not real Bolsheviks communist
ideals.
”
It was a miracle that he stayed alive after what he had said about the party officials.
My Father’s Family
My father’s side came from the city of Van in Turkey, which was one of the ancient capitals of
Armenia. Armenians from Van suffered relatively less during the Genocide than Armenians from
other cities in Turkey because they were able to organize an active resistance movement. Two
other areas did the same: Musa Dagh, a large mountainous village on the Mediterranean coast
whose population escaped by French ship, and Sassoun.Van was a rich and prosperous city with many schools, colleges and foreign missions. The
people were hard workers from various social classes—merchants, jewelers, lawyers, doctors,
priests. My father’s family was wealthy, and like many Armenians, they were good merchants.
One of the main characteristics of Armenians from Van is that they know how to make money
and, more importantly, know how to save money. One popular joke about Armenians from Van
is that in the morning, instead of wishing each other a good day, they ask,
“How much yellow
today?” (“yellow” meaning gold on the market).
During the Genocide, my grandfather, Khazar Gulnazarian, experienced many tragedies. His
first wife was killed by the Turks in front of him, and as he fled with his small daughter, he lost
her in the chaos. He never found her. He hoped she had become an American orphan, because
many American missionaries took Armenian babies to safety in the United States.
My grandfather managed to hide some gold and jewelry in the hems and collars of his clothing,
which helped him survive. His second wife, my grandmother, Nubar Iskandarian, had also
suffered greatly. Her first husband had been killed during the Genocide. She fled with her
three-year-old daughter, Maro, but during their escape, a Turk threw Maro to the ground and
stabbed her with his sword. It was a miracle she survived; they had no ointment or medicine.
With no other choice, my grandmother stitched her skin together with thread. When Auntie Maro
was older, we would always ask to see her scar.
During their escape, my grandfather and grandmother met and eventually married. They had
four children together—my father and my three aunts.
When my grandparents entered Erevan with the thousands of other Armenians fleeing the
Genocide, they saw huge orchards. They were so hungry that they began eating fruit as fast as
they could. Many developed dysentery, and half of them died. Can you imagine? They escaped
the Turks only to die in Armenia from poverty and sickness.
Among the thousands who fled the massacres was the family of Arshile Gorky, the founder of
abstract expressionism in the United States. His mother died of hunger during their escape, a
pain he carried his entire life.
It is impossible to find an Armenian family that didn’t suffer.
The Armenian Genocide caused a deep, inherited pain—a pain that comes from the milk
of our mothers. It is part of our existence. One and a half million Armenians were killed, and
we are still trying to tell the world that the Genocide happened. Even now the government of
Turkey refuses to accept it and continues to distort history.
Around 1970, the Soviet government finally built a memorial recognizing the Genocide. Until
then, we couldn’t speak openly about it. People were afraid of being accused of nationalism.
Everyone was supposed to be “Soviet.
” The ideal of communism was that everyone was equal,
working for one country, one idea. You could not think about yourself or your nation; you had to
think about society. We were told: “We are Soviet people. We are building a new era.
” The
Soviet Union also didn’t want to damage its relationship with Turkey.I remember one time when I was about ten. My father picked me up from school, and when we
got home and opened the mailbox, there was a photograph of Mount Ararat wrapped in chains,
surrounded by images of slaughtered Armenians. It symbolized our wounded, enslaved
motherland—the Genocide. On the photograph was the question: “How long will it take before
people accept the Genocide?”
I asked my father,
“What is this?”
He quietly crumpled the paper, put it in his pocket, and said,
“It is nothing. Let’s go home.
”
You never knew what could happen if someone from the ruling party or the KGB found you with
something like that. My life and the history of my country are deeply connected to the Genocide.
My Parents
My mother, Oktiabrina, was born on September 10, 1923, in Krasnodar. She was the oldest of
three sons and two daughters, and because of her mother’s poor health, she cared for the home
and family. Despite this, she finished high school with a gold medal for honors and passed the
university entrance exam. She always dreamed of becoming a doctor.
But when my father came back from World War II, he told her it was either him or the university.
He believed that if she went to school, she would never marry him. Because she loved him so
much, she chose my father over her dream. Eventually she became a registered nurse and
worked for more than fifty years.
My mother feared that because I was an only child, I might become selfish. If I took an apple,
she would say,
“Are you going to eat that by yourself? Did you ask your father? Did you ask
me?” I am grateful—she taught me to share and not think only about myself. She was also
pathologically honest. If I told her I bought something for $3, she would correct me: “Why are
you giving wrong information? You bought it for $2.97.
” Her honesty came from her father.
My father, Rafik, was born on March 15, 1922, in Erevan. He was smart, alert, audacious, and
romantic. Sometimes he would lie on the balcony and watch the clouds change shape. He and
my mother had been schoolmates for years. My mother was known as the model
student—organized, prepared, involved in everything. My father was known as a troublemaker,
always laughing and making noise. When my mother saw him in the school lobby, she walked
the other way so she wouldn’t have to say hello.
One day, everyone was in the sports hall except my mother. She stood by an open window
singing. When she finished, she turned to see my father standing behind her, admiring her.
“You
sing beautifully,
” he said. That was the beginning of their love story.
My father often told me about his childhood. When he was growing up, Erevan was transforming
from a provincial town with poor infrastructure into a modern city. From morning to night,barefoot boys sold drinking water in ceramic jugs. Competition among them was fierce. You
could hear their voices everywhere: “Cold water! Cold water from the fountains!” There is a
monument of a skinny boy carrying a water jug in one of Erevan’s central alleys. My father used
to laugh and say,
“That is me—when I was in the water-selling business.
”
He was brave and respected among his friends. One day, just before World War II, a KGB
officer told him they planned to send him to spy school. When he told my grandfather, my
grandfather said,
“It is better that my son be killed than for him to cause the death of other
people’s children.
” My father refused the assignment and was sent to the regular army instead.
He was seventeen.
At twenty-one, wounded from the war, he returned home and went to work at a textile factory.
He eventually became manager of one of its largest departments, and for twenty-five years
served as the Communist Party secretary of the factory. All institutions in the Soviet Union were
required to have a party secretary. I don’t think he really believed in the party, but he was a good
organizer and used his position to help people. He obtained many benefits for the workers. He
was kind, fair, independent, and principled.
My father deeply influenced my character. My love of nature, art, and books came from him.
Sometimes we even fought over who would read a new book first. He was a proud Erevantsi,
and as we walked through the city he would tell me stories about its historical buildings and the
people who had lived there. He loved his country. He admired Nikita Khrushchev for releasing a
million people from the hell of the GULAG. When I was sixteen, we visited Moscow, and he took
me to Khrushchev’s grave. It was in terrible condition, and my father was furious because he
respected him so much.
Armenian immigration has changed considerably in the course of the last century. The largest
wave came after World War II, when 700,000 Armenians immigrated to Europe or the United
States. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates about 60,000 Armenians came to the United States
between 1969 and 1980. Most settled in California, particularly in and around Los Angeles.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 26.2 percent of Glendale, California’s population identified
themselves as Armenian.
When we arrived, the streets were empty, quiet, side by side with lonely, naked palm trees
under the burning sun. No shade. When we had imagined the United States, we thought about
busy, noisy streets with skyscrapers. But the street where I lived looked like the countryside. I
was used to the city. This impression stayed with me until Souren showed me the downtown
area with modern architecture, sculptures, fountains, and of course, traffic.
I wanted to enjoy every part of the city, but it was shocking to see rich areas so close to
neighborhoods built out of ragged boxes, with people living in unbearable conditions. The
contrast between wealth and poverty was abnormal.
The year I was in Erevan without Souren, I felt lonely, but during the first months here—even
with my husband near me—I felt lonelier. My uncertain future depressed me. All my life I hadworked or studied. Here, I didn’t know what my occupation could be. I cried every day. I didn’t
know the language. Every day without information or news felt like living in a vacuum. For the
first year I thought I would go back to Armenia. I thought my stay was temporary.
But when my parents came, I knew it was not temporary. It would be a huge problem to take
them back.
At first my father refused to come to the United States, but my mother told him she was coming,
that she would die without her daughter. It was difficult for her to leave because she thought she
would never be able to return. Her whole life was in Armenia. My father forbade her to bring
anything with her because he planned to return in a few months. He thought he would see me
and then go back.
When my mother arrived in Los Angeles, she was disappointed. Like me, she thought it would
be like New York, but instead it looked like the countryside. She missed Erevan, the Armenian
trees, the people, the air—everything, but especially the trees. She said,
“My heart is in
Armenia, but my body is here.
” She worried constantly about what was happening there. She
had one wish for Armenia: that the government would leave and young, smart, educated people
would run the country.
Every day my father thought about going back. We could be eating dinner and he would take
seeds from his food, put them in a napkin, and save them for his orchard in Armenia. He always
talked about his orchard. I promised to bring him the best seeds in the United States. He waited
for his green card, but it never arrived. One day he realized that he would never go back, and he
collapsed.
My father died in 1998, five years after he and my mother came here. At his funeral, a friend
wrote:
“There is comfort in knowing that he is no longer suffering. The only sadness comes
from knowing that he died in a foreign land.
Here was a veteran who survived the Battle of Stalingrad as a seventeen-year-old
Armenian soldier conscripted into the Soviet Army, fighting the combined forces of
fascism.
His family’s only regret is that he was never able to see his beloved Armenia again,
or to cast his eyes on the sun setting behind Mount Ararat, or to walk through his
fruit orchard, inhaling the sweet fragrance of the persimmon and apricot blossoms.
”
Working in America
My first job was at a sewing factory. I can describe that time of my life in one word: slavery.After I got my work permit, I went to work in a Beverly Hills hotel in the housekeeping
department. It was humiliating to see the private lives of people I didn’t know. The work was
physically exhausting and emotionally painful. I cleaned thirteen or fourteen rooms every day,
earning maybe $7.25 an hour. Every day on my way home from work, I decided to quit—but the
reality of my life sent me back again and again.
“Why am I here? Why did God punish me and change my life?”
Then I answered myself: “You came here voluntarily. It is nobody’s fault. Your English and
qualifications are too limited.
”
I was desperate. I cried on my way to work. I cried on my way home. After work, I went to
English classes three nights a week, on top of working, shopping, cooking, and taking care of
my parents. I was exhausted. I was just running all the time. I didn’t exist.
Then something good happened.
Close to Christmas, management organized a Christmas party and asked whether anyone
could accompany the choir on the piano. I volunteered. I needed to show everyone that I was
not the person they thought I was. I could do more than housekeeping.
They must have wondered: “How could this housekeeper who can hardly understand English be
a musician?” But they were desperate and decided to give me a chance. During the week, I
found the music for the Christmas carols and began practicing with the choir. It was my time. I
enjoyed every moment. Office workers and receptionists—who had looked past me every
day—crowded around the piano, trying to sing properly under my direction.
I was thankful for my stubborn mother who had made me practice piano.
Finally, it was Christmas Eve. There I was, in a huge hall, playing the piano for the choir. My
heart was full of happiness, and I felt so much pride. After the performance, a corporate
employee approached our table. He could not understand how someone from the housekeeping
department could play the piano and lead a chorus.
That was my happiest day in the United States.
Here, a person without language is seen as stupid, a dummy. People look at you, but they don’t
really see you.
A New Start
When my English improved, I worked at Robinsons-May Department Store and then Nordstrom.
I have worked at Nordstrom for ten years—eight in accessories and the last two in handbags.Every day I see a huge, colorful gallery of people from all over the world: Europe, Vietnam,
China, Arab countries. Every day I learn something new from my customers and co-workers.
My Mother and I Visit Armenia
In September 2006, my mother and I returned to Armenia. I had strange feelings. I had known
Erevan all my life. Every block held memories. My heart whispered,
“Hello, my city—do you
remember me?”
I had missed the beautiful stone buildings and the huge maple trees on Mesrop Mashtots
Boulevard. I touched the walls, trying to bring back memories. In springtime, the streets of
Erevan were full of the sounds of birds returning after winter. They were so loud that sometimes
it was impossible to talk.
Everything looked familiar, yet something had changed. Then I understood: Erevan had lost its
spirit. The faces of the people had changed. It had once been a proud and prosperous
European city whose inhabitants had high self-esteem. I wished she could regain her charm and
dignity, and that the people who lived there could be happy and proud again.
Maybe this is the price of independence and the new capitalist economy.
Now there is a deep gap between the rich and the poor. The people are 80 percent poor and 20
percent rich. There is no middle class.
My mother took this very seriously. She said she didn’t see anything good. She felt we were
losing our nation. The new buildings were not for ordinary people—only for the wealthy.
Educated people were begging for money. She believed it was impossible to survive. She said it
had been better under communism because now people think only about their pockets. My
mother is an optimist, but she saw more bad than good.
Reflections
I was fragile before—like a flower under glass. Everything was good; everyone took care of me.
One of Souren’s American friends once asked him,
“Why do you need a Russian princess?” I
was raised on books, and books are not the real world.
Now I see that the world is wide. Before, my world was my country, my city, my street, my
friends, my movies, my music, my books.
I am stronger now. A different person.My mother thinks I’ve become ruder, harder. She sees me as tired, not the same person I was.
But she also sees me as more independent.
You have to work hard in a capitalist society. You need to be disciplined; you need strong
elbows to fight your way up the ladder. It’s the law of the wolf. Sometimes you lose your heart
and soul.
When I first saw homeless people, I was surprised and angry. You are an American. You know
the language. You are not an immigrant. But then I understood—maybe they got sick, maybe
they divorced, maybe something terrible happened. They were not strong enough to survive it. It
can happen to anyone.
One of my customers, a writer and a very nice lady, once told me she was living in a shelter. Her
teeth were in terrible condition. It can happen to anybody.
Here, you are responsible for yourself. Many of my young co-workers live alone. They work all
day, study at night, pay rent, insurance, bills. They don’t have time to read or go to museums.
They go through sickness, danger, drugs, terrible relationships—and nobody can stop them
because their parents live far away.
Maybe this makes them stronger, but sometimes they make tragic mistakes and no one is there
to intervene.
Armenian children live with their families until they get married, and even then their parents
continue to help them. Armenian parents want to give everything to their children. Then when
the children grow up, they take care of their parents. It’s a cycle. We respect our elders.
At work, I see many old, lonely people. Sometimes they spend all day in the store. Maybe their
children live far away. I cannot imagine leaving my mother alone. It would be a nightmare if
someone else cared for her.
Americans pay a high price for their independence. With independence comes loneliness. For
Armenians, loneliness is like damnation.
In America, people rush constantly; communication is a luxury. In Armenia, we always met over
coffee and talked about life. That closeness is therapy. We paid for a cup of coffee and received
therapy. Here, it seems everyone has a psychotherapist because they have no one to talk to.
In Armenia, privacy barely exists—if something happens, everyone helps. It’s about survival.
There is a saying:
“Don’t have $100; have 100 friends.
”
Duality in My SoulI miss my country. I miss my youth. I miss being a teacher. I miss my students.
I have been here sixteen years. This country has given me a lot. I have cried a lot. I have
worked a lot. This has become my country too.
Before, I thought it would be easy to go back, but now it would be difficult. When I say I am
going back, it is not sincere. Something keeps me here—my work, the people, friends, this
street. This is also my life.
From here, I see that Armenia is poor and fragile and needs our help and support. The United
States is a rich, strong, dominating stepmother. Armenia is our poor mother—but she is our
country.
There is an Armenian proverb:
“At first we admire our parents, then we criticize them, and at the end we pity them.
”
There is a duality in my soul. I am physically here, but my soul is still in Armenia—yet I cannot
imagine starting my life again.
You cannot step twice into the same river.
My Dream
It is a beautiful sunny day at Zvartnots International Airport in Erevan, Armenia. Airplanes are
lining up to land. Armenians from around the world are returning home. Newspaper headlines
read:
“Unbelievable Economic Boom in Armenia.
”
Everyone lives a prosperous and stable life. Smiles and happiness everywhere. There is no
crime, no corruption. Wide, beautiful highways lead people to the cities. The borders with our
neighbors are open. Biblical Ararat can rest—there is no more turmoil for this brave and loyal
nation. At last, the government of Turkey accepts the Armenian Genocide.
I recently read an article about the life of Pope John Paul II. In it he spoke about the history of
his own country, Poland, which shares a parallel history with ours. He could have been speaking
about Armenia:
“I am the son of a nation who was condemned by his neighbors to death.
My nation survived, not because we are physically strong, but because of our
culture.
”
