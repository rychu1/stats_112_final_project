Xidan’s Story
Early Life and Family Background
Xidan Wang was born on October 1, 1953, in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province—on the national holiday marking the founding of the People’s Republic of China. She graduated from medical school in 1977 and began her career at the Fifth People’s Hospital of Chongqing City at age twenty-seven. As China began opening its doors to the world, she trained as a plastic surgeon and eventually built a successful beauty spa business. In 1997, she married an American businessman from Taiwan, and in 1998 she immigrated to the United States.
This is her story.
Her Mother’s Family
When the Japanese invaded China, they entered through Lianyun Harbor in Jiangsu Province, where her mother’s family had lived for nine generations. Her mother, born in 1924, was the youngest of five children in an extremely wealthy family whose members often held high positions in the Qing Dynasty. Most of the city’s businesses—including banks, pawn shops, jewelry stores, grocery stores, and farmland—were owned by three powerful families, including hers. These families married only among themselves. Her grandfather had many mistresses, though her grandmother never allowed them in the home.
Japanese Invasion
During the Japanese occupation, her mother’s family fled to the countryside. When they returned, everything had been taken. The Japanese forces committed brutal acts: raping women—even pregnant women—killing children, stealing valuable clothing and jade buried with ancestors. They forced students to learn Japanese in schools. The invasion united people of different political beliefs because everyone suffered.
Her mother’s siblings joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), believing the Kuomintang (KMT) was too weak to stop the Japanese and drawn to the CCP’s ideals of helping the poor.
Her Father’s Family
Her father was born in 1924 in Xi’an City of Shaanxi Province. His family owned land and lived better than most but were not nearly as wealthy as her mother’s family.
When her father was two years old, his mother died after vomiting and suffocating from a roundworm infection—common at the time due to poor hygiene and lack of medical care. Her grandfather eventually remarried and had another son. At fifteen, her father secretly joined the CCP underground movement. His father tried to keep him home by forcing him to marry; he became a husband and father at a very young age. But he remained dedicated to fighting for the nation. At seventeen, he left home with a new revolutionary name, Zheng (“a sharp weapon”), given by the underground organization. He never saw his father again and did not know his wife was pregnant with their second child.
Her Mother Joins the CCP
In 1946, her mother went to Shanghai to study nursing at a missionary school and was recruited by the CCP underground. She was given the revolutionary name Hui (“bright like sunshine”).
In 1949, both parents joined a national program to train future government officials. Their group—2,500 students—became the People’s Republic of China Southwest Service Group. On October 1, 1949, while riding a train from Nanjing, they heard Mao Zedong announce the founding of the PRC. Her mother described the moment: students crying, cheering, hugging, throwing hats into the air, filled with pride and hope.
The March to Chongqing
The group walked thirty miles per day for two months to reach southwestern China. Her mother, a nurse, often walked ten additional miles to tend to the sick at the back of the line. Conditions were harsh—narrow dirt paths, insects, snakes, flimsy shoes, blistered feet. Yet they endured with what her mother called the “hot blood of patriotism.” They slept on bare ground, had no showers, yet no one complained. They encouraged local villagers by singing revolutionary songs.
Her mother believed passionately in Mao’s vision of equality—between rich and poor, and especially between men and women. She despised old traditions that restricted women to the home and celebrated the revolution for granting women full equality.
Upon arriving in Chongqing, her parents were assigned to work for the new government. They did not meet during the march but afterward, while working in the city. They married in 1952. Xidan was born in 1953, followed by her brother Xiao Li.
Childhood and Family Life
Xidan’s name reflected her parents’ revolutionary ideals—named partly after a Russian revolutionary heroine, partly after the color red, and partly for the city of Wuxi.
Her father worked in the General Labor Association and later became chief of the Ministry of Financial Affairs in Chongqing’s Southern District. Her mother worked in the Propaganda Department, teaching literacy in factories and promoting cultural and educational initiatives.
Her parents believed deeply in self-sacrifice for the nation. They often said:
“We gave you the biological body, but you are not our private property. You belong to this country.”
Government workers often worked fourteen-hour days, six days a week. Children were commonly raised by nannies due to long work hours. Xidan and her brother lived with a nanny, “Nanny Momma,” until age eight. She loved her deeply and remained connected to her throughout her life.
Living Conditions
Their family lived in a one-room government apartment with no kitchen or bathroom. Cooking was forbidden at home. Everyone ate in the canteen, where they also received bottled water. Public toilets were shared; public showers had 20–30 stalls. People waited in long lines every morning.
Her mother, once wealthy and pampered, was now ashamed of her background. In the new government, being rich was considered “black blood.” No pictures or stories of family heritage were allowed. Xidan did not learn about her family history until she was a teenager.
Education
Education was free and mandatory. If parents tried to keep children at home to work, officials intervened. The curriculum included Chinese, math, history, politics, arts, and Russian in middle school. She took free dance and gymnastics classes.
Children joined political youth groups:
* Red Collar Group (ages 7–16) — nearly everyone joined

* Youth Communist Group (ages 16–20) — selective; required talent, good grades, and good deeds

She joined the Youth Communist Group in medical school, but later rejected the idea of joining the Communist Party, partly due to her family background and partly due to the Cultural Revolution’s impact.
Life During the Cultural Revolution
When she was thirteen, the Cultural Revolution began. The entire country stopped—workplaces, schools, everything. Students carried Mao’s Little Red Book everywhere. They wore army uniforms, red armbands, and Mao pins. Every home displayed Mao’s portrait, similar to religious imagery in other cultures.
Every morning, loudspeakers played revolutionary music. Everyone stopped what they were doing, held Mao’s book to their hearts, and recited chants praising Mao. Not participating signaled political disloyalty. Her father, embarrassed at first, practiced dancing at home in order to appear loyal.
The Red Guard divided people into “red,” “black,” and “gray.” Her family fell into the “black” category because of their wealthy background.
Historical Note: The Cultural Revolution (1966–1976)
The Cultural Revolution, begun by Mao Zedong, was an attempt to restore his authority. Mao believed that the economic plans made by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were steering China toward capitalism. He turned to the military and the masses—especially middle-school, high-school, and college students who became the Red Guard—to restart the class struggle and overthrow his enemies.
The Red Guard used Mao’s slogan “Rebellion is justified” and destroyed books, artworks, anything Western, and anything predating the revolution. Schools closed in June 1966. Intellectuals were sent to re-education camps to practice “self-criticism,” often facing humiliation and torture. As violence escalated, the military intervened.
Family backgrounds were inspected over three generations. Families were categorized as red, black, or gray. Despite my parents being rich landowners, I was placed in the gray category because they had helped build the new China. My brother and I were forbidden to join the Red Guard. The Red Guard stoned us, called us names, and attacked our home. I still have a scar on my face from those attacks.
They burned my mother’s beloved international literature collection. Though she accepted the loss of her belongings, the loss of her books devastated her. After the Cultural Revolution, she bought them again.
My parents were repeatedly sent to labor camps between 1966 and 1967. They studied Mao’s Little Red Book, reflecting on every “bad thought.” If their thinking was deemed correct, they were released; if not, they stayed. During this time, I stopped calling them “Father” and “Mother” and referred to them as antirevolutionaries.
The Cultural Revolution destroyed families across China. My own extended family suffered suicides, torture, imprisonment, and death.

Working With Farmers in the Countryside
In 1968, when I was fifteen, Mao asked students to go to the mountains and countryside to be re-educated by farmers. Although only students sixteen and older could go, I registered anyway to prove my revolutionary loyalty. My parents feared for my safety but had to publicly approve.
The village conditions were extremely poor: water from a well, kerosene lamps, straw beds, and—in some cases—only one pair of pants for a household. Six million students were sent to the countryside that year.
I received a six-month food quota and a small plot for vegetables. Not knowing how to cook, I gave my food quota to a farmer’s family in exchange for meals. I worked long days planting crops, walking long distances, and developing blisters. My home was a storage shed infested with rats.
Saturdays were Market Days, when students met and often cried together. Students who misbehaved—stealing or causing trouble—strained relations with farmers, though some farmers were abusive as well. Many classmates felt abandoned by the government.
I had a good relationship with the farmers, who respectfully called me “comrade.” But I suffered psychologically, even contemplating suicide. A kind farmer discovered my despair and comforted me.
One Saturday, I saw military recruiters seeking performers. With experience in gymnastics and dance, I auditioned. When accepted, I gave all my belongings to the farmers before leaving.

Joining the Artistic Army
I joined the Art and Literature Group of the Railroad Soldiers, a branch of the People’s Liberation Army whose job was to build a railroad from Sichuan to Shanxi. Our performance troupe entertained soldiers and competed with other groups. I danced and played the pipa.
After my two-year service, I refused a government job in the city. To attend university, I believed I needed more practical experience—so I returned to the countryside.

Becoming a “Barefoot Doctor”
In the countryside, I joined doctors traveling to villages to provide basic medical care. I carried a medicine box, learned acupuncture and herbal medicine, and walked up to twenty-five miles a day. Watching people healed by acupuncture inspired me to become a doctor, fulfilling my mother’s dream.
To enter medical school, I needed to pass exams in Chinese composition, math, and Maoist political theory. My father—still politically sidelined—received permission to tutor me in the countryside. I passed the exam in July 1973, but my top choice rejected me for having a “gray” family background. When my father was politically rehabilitated, my record was cleared and I was admitted to North Sichuan Medical College.
________________


Medical School (1973–1977)
I began medical school at nineteen; my classmates ranged widely in age. During my final year, I trained at the county hospital in Langzhong County, rotating through internal medicine, surgery, neurology, gynecology, and infectious diseases. I encountered diseases such as roundworm, hookworm, elephantiasis, diphtheria, and hemorrhagic fever.
Rural clinics were severely under-equipped—knives and needles were sterilized by boiling water. Each clinic served about thirty square miles with one doctor, one nurse, and medical students. I experienced difficult cases, including a woman who cut open her abdomen in labor to deliver her baby. Miraculously, both survived.

Opening the Infectious Disease Department
In 1977, I became a doctor and later joined the Number Five People’s Hospital in Chongqing. There was no separate infectious disease department—patients were mixed with others, increasing infection risks. I helped convert an abandoned hospital area into a proper infectious disease ward and became the youngest chief of a department at twenty-eight.
I loved helping people but often felt helpless due to a lack of treatments.

Starting My Cosmetology Business
Before China’s economic reforms, fashion was strictly controlled. After China opened up, people wanted beauty, style, and cosmetic improvements. With medical and artistic experience, I opened a comprehensive beauty center offering facials, massage, makeup, hairstyling, exercise, and cosmetic surgery.
I employed doctors, nurses, and department managers. My business flourished. Women wanted to change their features—often to look more “Western.” I rejected clients seeking procedures only to please boyfriends and encouraged women to be confident and independent.
In 1994, the government created a national cosmetology standards organization. I became vice president of the Chongqing branch, helped write national training standards, drafted exam questions, wrote textbooks, and lectured across China.
By Chinese standards, I was very successful—“walking uphill,” always striving for improvement.

My First Marriage
At twenty-five, my family insisted I marry to avoid gossip. Though I wanted independence and feared losing myself, I had to consider tradition and family expectations. Growing up, I viewed sex as dirty and purely for procreation; love, to me, was spiritual—shaped by Western novels I read secretly.
During the Cultural Revolution, romance was considered bourgeois. Marriages required approval from work bureaus, and applications described marriage as service to the revolution. Divorce was rare.
In 1978, I was introduced to Mr. Yang, who worked in Chongqing. He was shy; I talked more. I told him that he must not interfere with my career and that, before discussing marriage, we should spend years supporting and competing with each other professionally. This was unusual at the time, when others discussed savings and living arrangements. To me, that was boring.
Mr. Yang and the End of the Relationship
The second time we met, Mr. Yang tried to touch me. I didn’t think we were close enough for this and concluded he was no different from other men. I told him I wanted to end the relationship and focus on my work. Mr. Yang spoke with my parents, and as a result, my father wrote me a fourteen-page letter detailing Mr. Yang’s educational achievements and other advantages.
My parents didn’t understand me. In Chinese culture, children never discuss their insides with their parents.
After reading my father’s letter, I took a short trip to Xi’an to give myself time to think. When I returned, there was a letter from Mr. Yang showing his sadness. I asked him to come see me so I could explain why I wanted to end our relationship. When I saw him, I felt so sad—he had lost thirty pounds. Then I started thinking that maybe everyone was right and I should get married. After all, he was not a bad person and was sincere about marriage.
Another reason I agreed to marry him was that I never wanted to hurt my parents again. During the Cultural Revolution, I had once thought of stealing ammunition to kill my father. Even though I never acted on it, the guilt stayed with me.
Mr. Yang and I became engaged in 1979 and married in June 1980. On my wedding day, I felt nothing—I simply followed my culture.

Pregnancy and the One-Child Policy
During our three-day honeymoon (the government allowed only three days), I became pregnant. I had never thought about having children. I didn’t want to be a woman without her own career or identity, serving her husband and children. I am not a traditional Chinese woman. At that moment, I felt I had no future.
Historical Note: The One-Child Policy
Announced in 1979 and implemented in the early 1980s to control China’s population of 1.1 billion. Couples needed permission from their work units to have children. Mothers working for the government received one year of paid maternity leave.
________________


Childbirth and Postpartum Tradition
Close to my due date, my husband’s parents asked me to come to their home in Chengdu so they could care for me. In China, grandparents traditionally help after a baby is born; if none are available, couples hire a professional caretaker.
My baby was born on April 30, 1981. I named him Hong Bin, wishing him ambition and great achievements.
Women receive sixty days of paid postpartum rest. During this period:
   * No showers

   * No hair washing or combing

   * Must wear a hat and socks

   * Only drink hot water and eat special foods

   * Windows must stay closed

   * Must lie in bed and be served

   * Not allowed to read

These sixty days felt like prison. Whenever my in-laws left, I would sneak out books and hide them when they returned. My mother-in-law, a gynecologist, told me reading would harm my eyes.
________________


Returning to Work and Early Family Life
After the sixty days, I felt relieved—I could return to my life and work. My in-laws kept the baby. Six months after Hong Bin’s birth, the one-child policy went into effect, and I decided to use my remaining maternity leave to stay home with him. I worried he would be spoiled by grandparents who valued boys more than girls.
I brought him back to Chongqing, where my husband and I lived in my parents’ home, then later in a dormitory room at my husband’s research institute.
Living conditions were better than those of my parents’ generation, though still basic: no flushing toilets, communal showers, and a canteen for meals. Drinking water had to be collected in thermoses.
________________


Teaching My Son and Domestic Violence
When Hong Bin was one year old, I began teaching him to count. Children resist and cry. My husband thought he was too young. We fought constantly.
At sixteen months, I began teaching him to read clocks. One afternoon, after waking him from a nap, my husband became so angry he grabbed whatever he could and hit me. I felt humiliated. I put my son on the floor and left the house.
Although hitting women was illegal, the culture tolerated it. Women never complained; they were too ashamed.
When my husband put the baby to sleep, he went searching for me. I hid. While he was outside, I climbed through the window, took my clothes, and left. I could not go to my parents’ home—they would blame me. I went to my Nanny Momma’s home.
My husband brought his parents to Chongqing to ask me to forgive him. They promised he would not hit me again and urged me to return for the baby’s sake.
________________


The Seeds of Divorce
The seeds of divorce were planted early. We fought about our child’s education, my work, and our sex life. I was busy building my infectious disease department. His work stagnated. The gap between us widened.
When my child was a year old, I became pregnant again, but due to the one-child policy, I had to have an abortion.
My husband wanted sex constantly. I was exhausted and did not want to risk pregnancy again. Many times he forced me. In China, there were no laws against husbands raping their wives.
________________


The Final Incident and Filing for Divorce
The divorce happened suddenly. I needed a train ticket for a medical conference, and a patient’s uncle helped me get one. My patient and I left the station together. At that time, it was unacceptable for a woman to walk in public with a man who was not her husband. My husband saw us.
When I returned home, he became furious, accused me of having an affair, beat me, and raped me. There was nothing I could say or do to stop him. I knew then I had to file for divorce.
My son stayed with his father. I moved into a room at the hospital. I saw my son every weekend, but he was very sad. Divorce was unusual, and he didn’t want anyone to know.
After three months, I sued for divorce. My husband refused at first and rallied others to stop me. He did not think he had done anything wrong. Traditionally, sex was a husband’s right, and a woman could never say no.
I was fortunate to have a female judge. She asked why I tolerated the abuse so long. I explained that violent sex and rape were common, but women were too ashamed to speak out. She granted me the divorce and said I was a hero.

Life After Divorce
My marriage ended in 1991. I devoted myself to work and began dancing again, where I met Mr. Ma. Because of my social status, I needed to avoid scandal, so I asked him to bring his wife to practice—he never did. He had already secretly divorced her.
Mr. Ma wanted us to compete as partners. He said we needed spontaneity, and to reach that level, we should become lovers. He was worldly, romantic, called me “darling,” held doors open, and taught me to enjoy sex. We fell in love, and I moved in with him.
Public opinion—my hospital, political party, and parents—disapproved, but I didn’t care.
Mr. Ma charmed everyone, including my employees. Some customers suspected him of being involved with one of my young workers. Eventually, he admitted he had slept with her. I quietly packed my things and left. He had betrayed me and harmed a vulnerable eighteen-year-old rural girl.
I was heartbroken—this was my first experience of real love.
I began to feel Chinese men came in only two types:
      1. Traditional like my first husband—responsible but treating wives like property.

      2. Playboys like Mr. Ma—charming but unfaithful.

Marriage to Mr. Lin
My family pressured me to marry again. At the time, single women did not live alone. Today things have changed: women earn their own money, have careers, and can live independently. Still, if a woman holds a higher position or makes more money, men appear weak—something Chinese women dislike.
I met Mr. Lin in 1996 at a beauty-product exhibition. He was an American citizen from Taiwan seeking investment opportunities. I wasn’t in love, but I trusted him. He seemed like the Western men from novels—men who respected their wives. I also wanted to end my family’s pressure.
We married about a year later. My first wedding had been simple; my second was extravagant—500 guests, a big hotel, a television host, ballroom dancers. China was changing, and people were spending money freely.

Coming to the United States
Even after marrying, I never intended to move to the U.S. Many married couples in China live apart because of work. But my husband complained constantly that living separately wasn’t a marriage. He promised to help me start a new business. I trusted him and didn’t ask questions.
A year and a half after our wedding, I gave up everything and moved.
My family and forty friends came to the airport to say goodbye. My mother, brother, and son were sad, but my friends were excited and envious. They believed I was going to heaven, to a land of opportunity.
But I was more worried than happy.
I arrived in Los Angeles on July 4, 1998. The airport was huge and crowded—not like Chinese airports then. My husband’s friend picked us up.
When I reached my new home in Gardena, I almost fainted. The house was tiny and worn. In China, I lived in a modern high-rise with three large bedrooms and a music system. Chongqing was a big, fast, modern city. Here, the neighborhood felt empty and lifeless.
I knew no one. I had no language, no money, no independence. I waited every day for my husband to drive me to adult school. Chinese say that without language you live in a prison. It was true for me.
________________


The Struggle to Adapt
I made frequent calls home at first, but my husband became angry over a bill under $100. I stopped calling and wrote letters instead.
I tried hard to learn English. After Thanksgiving, my husband bought me a used car. I hit a car while backing up; he became angry and warned I could be sued. I was terrified and stopped going to that school.
One day, desperate to learn English, I drove his new Mazda without permission to find another school. I hit a lamp pole. The airbags deployed. The car was totaled. He yelled at me for not waiting. I felt he didn’t understand my need to build a life. Afterward, he refused to talk to me. I stopped eating and sleeping and eventually fainted, ending up in a hospital. The bill was $1,500. In China, this would have cost about $10.
My husband demanded that I pay him back. I had brought no money because he told me his salary would support us. In China, he had used my money. I expected to rely on him at first. He was my husband. Supporting me was his responsibility.
But after this incident, I knew the marriage was a mistake. Still, I couldn’t divorce him because my visa status depended on him. I couldn’t return to China as a failure—without face.

Determination and Starting Over
I told myself I would make it in America step by step. I returned to night school and searched Chinese newspapers for jobs. My first interview was at a cosmetic store; they didn’t care about my certificates but tried to sell me $100 of products.
I realized I needed a cosmetology license. The school told me I didn’t need classes but needed proof of my certificates and a $1,000 preparatory class. I borrowed $500 from my husband and asked my mother for the rest.
Every night I studied until 2 a.m. My Chinese-English dictionary became my only teacher. My husband refused to tutor me in English; I had no friends. So I memorized everything.
In December 1999, a year and a half after arriving, I took the exam with fifty-six others from around the world. Only seven passed. I passed.

Working in Salons and Learning English
I worked in a San Gabriel Valley salon three days per week doing facials and hair for $30 a day plus tips. I later worked at a bigger, more fashionable salon, then at a Los Angeles salon full-time.
Although I was in the U.S. nearly two years, I had only two months of school and spoke very little English. I communicated with gestures and repeated “sorry” and “thank you” hundreds of times. It was humiliating.
One day a customer accused me of burning her eyebrows, though I hadn’t done the work. I couldn’t defend myself. I couldn’t sleep that night.
When I had no customers, I read children’s books from the library—Babysitter’s Club, Judy Blume. My electronic dictionary stayed with me at all times.
A customer eventually offered to teach me English. She gave me hope. I memorized job-related phrases and used English with customers. She also helped me study for my citizenship test. I loved learning American history and culture.
Preparing My Son for America
Before he left China, I had a serious conversation with him. I told him not to imagine that the United States was a paradise, because the truth was that life here was tough for immigrants and he needed to prepare himself psychologically. I didn’t want him to come here and be disappointed. I told him that my life here was very different from my life in China. My small salary was not enough to fully support him, and he would need to learn how to take care of himself. I told him that here, if you are dependent on your parents, you will feel shame. I wanted my son to be prepared.
After I returned from China, I bought a condominium so that my son could have his own room. I also prepared a room for my mom, hoping she would one day come to the United States. But she never came. She died in China on January 28, 2008.
The condominium was in Monterey Park, which is about 70 percent Chinese, so life was much easier for me. I was around Chinese people. I could walk to restaurants and stores. Many of the people I met in the restaurants became my customers. The best part was that I could use my language.
My husband didn’t think that my son should live with us. He said that in the United States, when kids turn eighteen, they live by themselves. I told him that this was not the Chinese way.
My son arrived in Los Angeles on July 6, 2000, two years and two days after I arrived. When he got off the plane, he was wearing expensive clothing and shoes. I told him that if he wanted to fit in here, he couldn’t dress that way, and I went out immediately to buy him less expensive clothing and shoes.

My Son’s Adjustment and Education
My son adjusted to life here quickly. In the first week, he passed the written test for his driver’s license. In the second week, he found a job in a Chinese restaurant as a busboy. He had never worked before, and in the beginning it was like a new game to him. He didn’t know how hard it would be. He often worked twelve hours without a break and would come home very tired. But he learned a lot of skills. He started as a busboy and then worked as a cook and later a waiter.
His goal was to go to college. At first, he enrolled in computer classes in a private school, and after he received his green card, he began taking classes at East Los Angeles College. After two years, he transferred to the University of California at Riverside, where he received his Bachelor’s degree in math. After that, he went to the University of Texas at Austin for his Master’s degree. He now attends Columbia University, where he is working on his Ph.D. My son is a very good student. He has received straight A’s in all the classes he has taken here.

Reflections
I always like to ask my customers about their dreams for the future. What do they want to achieve in their lives? What is important to them? Many tell me that they want to find a handsome, rich man who will buy them a nice house, a new car, and beautiful dresses. They want someone to take care of them. This surprises me. They don’t have a larger dream or goal for their lives. They don’t have a sense of nationalism or feel obligated to do things for their country.
They have infinite freedoms, but they don’t have any sublime ideals.
This is so different from China. From an early age, children are taught in school that their lives must have a higher purpose. Success is when you make a big change in your country. Mao didn’t make a lot of money, but he changed the whole country. He made people’s lives better. That is success. This is also the meaning of face. When my mother died, she gave her body to science. That is face.
Another thing I’ve noticed is how different families are here. In China, families are very close. I don’t see that here. There is no mutual concern or support, and as a result, their relationships with their families are distant. I have young customers who move out of the house when they are eighteen. This is too young. They live tough lives. They work to pay for rent and food. They can’t even afford to go to school. This would never happen in China.
In China, parents have the responsibility to take care of their children until they can take care of themselves, no matter what age. Kids are totally dependent on their parents. They can’t even do the simplest things, like cook or do laundry. Their only job is to study. This has always been our culture, but now, because of the one-child policy, each child has six parents to take care of him or her—the mother and father and two sets of grandparents. The father helps the child with homework, and the grandparent peels the grapes and feeds them to the child.
When the parents are old, the children take care of them. There is a saying in China: “Raise your kids for your retirement.” Until my mother died, I spoke with her every Thursday night, and my brother visited her every day. She needed the warmth and conversation.
I have a customer who is eighty-nine years old. Every week she comes to me for a massage. I have become the person she depends on because her daughter lives far away. Women like her need and deserve more attention and care.

China’s Change
While many of the old traditions remain in China, change is happening very fast. China is like a sleeping lion that has awakened. Thirty years ago, we didn’t even have radios in China. Our movies were old, and our clothes were not fashionable. When relatives brought new things to China, it was very exciting.
Now change is happening very fast. The economy has experienced rapid growth. People from all over the world are beginning to start businesses. I am very proud of that, but I worry that some of the changes have happened too fast and that there hasn’t been time to evaluate them. People’s thinking has changed. China is becoming more like the United States. People only care about money. Their dreams are not about the good of the country, but about themselves. I don’t think this is good.
My generation had the responsibility to make our country stronger. We had important ideals. We had the hot blood of patriotism. This generation feels none of that.
No matter how much China has changed, no matter how much China has become like the United States, Chinese people still come together around a common purpose. You could see this in the devastating earthquake that hit China on May 12, 2008. Everyone helped. Everyone came together. The government immediately asked every city to set up a collection area. The army responded quickly. Famous people like Yao Ming and Jet Li set up foundations, and others helped however they could.
You could also see this pride during the 2008 Olympics in China. We wanted to show our country to the world. For many years, China had been closed to the rest of the world. Most people thought China was poor, with no education or human rights. We wanted to show that China has a long history with many achievements and that we want to live together in peace, with respect for all people. Chinese people, wherever they were in the world, watched the 2008 Olympics with pride.

My Life Today
I don’t know if I will stay in the United States. I have made a life here. I like America, but I had a larger goal for my life. I would love to start my own business here, but that doesn’t seem possible. My language is not good enough, and I don’t have the funds I need.
In China, I knew that if I worked hard, I could accomplish my goals. I just don’t know how to do that here. Sometimes I feel sad. But I have friends around me who tell me never to give up my dream. In my heart, I never give up. That’s my personality.
