As a Chinese-American student who is second generation, I learned a lot more about the parallels to what my parent’s lives were like as first generation immigrants to the United States. In Phillip’s talk, she spoke about a Chinese immigrant named Xidan. Xidan said “face is very important in China, without face, you should die... if I don’t succeed it brings shame to my family and friends.” This was the reason why Xidan stayed in the United States even though she wanted to live in China. It seems stupid, but it is an actual reason why Chinese immigrants never go back to their home country. All the people mentioned in the talk left behind everything to immigrate. In Xidan’s case, this meant her language, her job, her friends and family, and her education. Both my parents had professional degrees in China, but when they came to America, they had no choice but work in unskilled, minimum wage jobs. Immigrating is like starting a new life.
