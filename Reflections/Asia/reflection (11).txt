From the lecture given by the guest speaker, I got a deeper impression of how the first generation of immigration family feels. The Chinese woman Xidan impressed me the most. She does not like America at all, but she does not want to go back to China either. She stays in the US to avoid contact with people that knew her in China because she does not want to “lose face”, which is a big problem that most east-Asian first-generation people have. When people go to America, most likely they will have a bad job compared to what they had in their hometown. First, because they do not speak English as well as native speakers do, they cannot continue their original professional job. Next, they do not have a social network to help them in a new country, so it is hard for them to look for jobs. However, the reason they come to America is that they want a better life compared to their original life. It is very difficult for them to accept the difference between their expectation and reality. And immigrants do not want others to know that they failed and fell down so hard. I understand what Xidan feels in America because I felt exactly the same last year. I got major depression and was hospitalized in America. I failed all my classes in that quarter and I needed to take a break from school. At that time, everybody told me that I need to apply for an absence from school and go back to China, but I overstayed in America for almost 4 months. Going to America and studying abroad was a big decision for me and I came here with people’s hope and best wishes. It was not acceptable for me to go back home as a loser and it was so hard to face my family and my old friends if I did not come back with honor and success. Due to my own experience, I really care about those immigrants who expected a better life but actually suffered in the US.
