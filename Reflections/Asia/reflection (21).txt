Chapter 2: I think it is very interesting to learn about the perspectives of those who lived under communism given the fact that many of us have grown up in America, a capitalistic country. Individualism is a very American concept so it is thought-provoking to see how people are so willing to sacrifice their lives for the collective good, especially when Xidan’s parents worked so much that they didn’t get to see her or her brother very often. I didn’t know about the red/black/gray categories that people were divided into and how the Cultural Revolution destroyed families, as Xidan had to treat her parents badly because of their family background and how she even considered killing him with a gun. One can’t help but feel that communism has taken their children. I really admire how Xidan and her mom were so able to become amiable with everyone around them and to adapt quickly. I especially respect Xidan for instilling confidence in her patients and for refusing to do procedures because the client’s boyfriend told them to. The language barrier that Xidan faced when she relocated to the U.S. resonated with me because my dad told me a lot of stories of what life was like when he immigrated here. He frequently was misunderstood at restaurants and everywhere else but over the years he has learned to adapt and now those awkward experiences he had are funny to him. Overall, Xidan’s story was an emotional rollercoaster and it was a great read.
