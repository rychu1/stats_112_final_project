My view on immigration didn’t completely change, but it became much deeper. I already knew that
people move for different reasons, but I never fully understood the personal sacrifice involved. The
The film showed women who were once doctors and teachers working in factories or as nail technicians.
This made their stories very real. I began to see immigration not just as a statistic, but as many
individual stories of loss, courage, and starting over. I now understand that the personal cost of
leaving home is very high. I was most surprised by how the women in the book handled losing their old jobs and identities. In many cultures, your job is a big part of who you are. To go from a respected profession to a simple labor job must have been very difficult. Yet, they faced this challenge with great strength. They did not seem bitter. Instead, they focused on working hard and building a new life for their families. Their ability to adapt and stay strong was what surprised and impressed me the most. As a student from China, I related most to She-don. I understood the cultural background she came from, especially the focus on education and career. I could also connect with her struggle to express herself in a new language. When you can’t speak a language fluently, people don’t see how much
you really know. I can imagine how frustrating that must have been for her, especially since she was
a doctor. Her story reminds me that people who move to a new country have hidden talents and
deep personal histories that aren’t always visible on the surface. After hearing their stories, I asked myself: What does it cost to fit into a new culture? When you try to adapt, what parts of yourself do you have to change or give up? I don’t have a clear answer. From the stories, it seems you don’t lose your old self completely. Instead, you create a new identity that is a mix of the old and the new. You carry your past with you as you learn to live in the present. As an international student, my experience is very different from the women in the book. I came to the U.S. for school, knowing that I can return home. Their decision to leave their countries was permanent and much harder. However, I do understand the feeling of living between two worlds. At UCLA with my friends, I am more open and direct, like in American culture. When I call my family in China, I speak and act differently, following our own traditions. It sometimes feels like I am two different people.
