Yes, my views on immigration changed in some ways. Before, I mostly thought about
immigration as a practical challenge,learning a new language, finding a job, and adjusting to a
new place. But after reading the stories and listening to Ms. Philps, I started to understand more
deeply the emotional side of immigration, especially for women. I realized how much courage it
takes to rebuild a life while balancing family expectations, cultural identity, and personal dreams.
It made me appreciate how strong and resilient immigrant women are. What surprised me most was their attitude. Even though many of them faced loneliness, discrimination, and confusion in a new culture, they still kept hope and determination. Instead of giving up, they used their experiences to grow stronger and help others. Their sense of community and quiet strength really inspired me. I identified most with the Chinese woman in the book because I am Chinese too. I could relate to her feelings of being caught between two cultures,trying to respect traditions while also wanting to fit into a new society. Her struggle with language and cultural misunderstanding reminded me of my own experiences when I first came here. Seeing her courage made me feel proud of my heritage and more confident about finding my own balance. One question I asked myself was, “Am I strong enough to change, like the women in the book?”
My answer is that strength doesn’t mean not feeling afraid,it means moving forward even when
you are. I realized that change is part of growth, and that being an immigrant gives me a unique
strength and perspective. As an immigrant, I have learned how important patience and self acceptance are. At first, I felt embarrassed about my accent and nervous about speaking English. But over time, I found that most people appreciate when you try. I also learned that keeping my culture is not something to hide, it’s something to share. These experiences taught me to be open-minded, empathetic, and
proud of where I come from.
