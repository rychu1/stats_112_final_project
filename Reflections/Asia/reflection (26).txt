Yes, they did. Before reading the book and watching the short film, I kind of thought of immigration in a simple way like moving for a better life or job. But after hearing the women’s stories and Ms. Philps’ talk, I realized how emotional and complicated it really is. It’s not just moving to another country, it’s rebuilding everything again from the start. I was surprised by how strong they were. Many of them faced discrimination and loneliness, but they didn’t give up. They still worked hard and cared for their families. That kind of quiet strength really touched me. I felt most connected to the Chinese woman who tried to keep her culture while adjusting to a new one. I understand that feeling of trying to belong in two worlds at once. I asked myself what “home” really means. I think now it’s not only a place, but a feeling of being accepted. As an international student, sometimes I feel lost or unsure of myself, especially at first. But I’ve learned to be open, to listen, and to find strength in small steps. This book reminded me that identity is something we build little by little, through every challenge.
