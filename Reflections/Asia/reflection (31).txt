She captured the voices of immigrant women from China, Russia, Armenia, and Mexico with deep empathy and respect. Her stories showed that every immigrant carries invisible challenges from leaving behind family to fighting stereotypes and discrimination as a foreigner. As someone who also lives as an international student in the US who is a minority people, I was able to relate to their experiences of being misunderstood or overlooked, even though I am not a woman myself. The most thing what surprised me is the emotional strength and independency of women. Although there are cultural barriers and discrimination to them, they found way to build their new identities through education and effort. Many people who came to the US with having language barrier and jobs, they have to face with quiet determination. I was also impressed by how she didn’t portray them as victims but as individuals who are fighting to make their future. Their stories made me realize that my challenges as a Korean student are real and immigrant women often face additional layers of struggle like balancing gender expectation, financial pressure and cultural adjustment at the same time. I personally connected the most with the Asian women from China. Being an Asian alien myself, I related to the sense of isolation, language barriers and the feeling of being “different” in a society. As an international student from South Korea, many of her experiences struggling to express ourselves in English can be judged based on appearance or accent and trying to find a new place in a new culture felt similar and familiar to me. After reading the book I want to ask myself “What does it truly mean to belong?” 3 years in the US have taught me that belonging doesn’t happen automatically, but it is something I have to create through openness, connection and effort. I have learned that adaptation doesn’t mean losing who I am but it means expanding myself. Watching the video helped me realize that there is always a person who is struggling more than me. As an international male student from South Korea, my journey in the US has been full of lessons. The language barrier was my biggest challenge at first, expressing complex thoughts in English often made me feel limited, especially in academic discussions. There were also moments when I felt subtle discrimination for being Asian or for not fitting into typical social groups honestly. But with that time, I have learned to see these challenges as opportunities for growth. I have adapted to the American education system, built friendships with people from different backgrounds, and learned to value cultural differences instead of being intimidated by them.
