My views on immigration didn’t really change after reading the stories, but they reaffirmed my beliefs that moving to a new country is extremely difficult. As a child of immigrants I’ve heard stories from my mom and grandma that are similar to the experiences of the women mentioned in the book. The thing that surprised me the most was the one of them had polio. Living in the United States since birth polio was just something you got a shot for, but learning about the effect it had on a real person opened my eyes to how terrible of a disease it was and encouraged me to keep up with my vaccines. As a Chinese American I guess I identified with the Chinese woman the most, but most of the struggles the women experienced I personally don’t really identify with as a 3rd generation. I’ve been lucky enough to have parents that can speak fluent english and have assimilated with American culture. After reading these stories I asked myself what it means to be an American, and I decided it meant the freedom to pursue, express, and conduct myself the way I want Personally I’m not an immigrant, but my parents came at 9 and 16. My mom coming when she was 9 struggled with learning english at first, but quickly assimilated due to coming at such a young age. My dad on the other hand left behind many of his friends and family in Hong Kong, and would frequently visit home because he hated America when he first came. However, as he grew and met my mom in college he slowly started to assimilate into Chinese American culture, and now he’s happy to be here because of the opportunity America has provided for my sister and myself.
