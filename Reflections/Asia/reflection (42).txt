Yes, in my old opinion the when immigrants choose to immigrate, they already have all the things to face the challenges in the new country. But this book and talk show me that not everyone has everything, but they are also brave to do something, even if the language and culture are diNerent. Now, I am receptive to each immigrant; they are brave and successful in my mind. The women in the books always face life challenges in their home country, but they do not give up and make themselves better. When they come to the United States, they face barriers such as the language. They do not feel disappointment in their life; they just face it and overcome it. Those made me surprised because when I face those things, I will be sad. The women from China are called the Xidan Wang. I was so identified that he talks in the book, she said that “ her parents taught them, to make life make sense, you must have a bigger goal and higher purpose. This is the big I .” This sentence I have been taught when I started my study life, that is why I withdrew from my college life in China, and went to the US to restart. I want to achieve my academic goal, not just see. If I have the chance to immigrate, what decision do I need to make? I answer is, if the immigrant will make my life better, I will choose to go there. Even if life has so many hard challenges, I would like this book to face and solve them. I am not an immigrant, but I learned some immigrants' stories in the book. Xidan’s story told me that even in a foreign country, we need to remember our home country’s culture. Moreover, when people face a challenge in life should not give up, just deal with it and solve it. You will be better.
