Susan Phillips was probably my favorite speaker and had a very enlightening talk. First, I really appreciated how moving and powerful her video featuring all the different women from different backgrounds was. I found the Chinese woman most fascinating. Susan explained how she came from a successful background in China as a plastic surgeon and worked in a senior position at a hospital. Then she moved to America, married a man whom she will divorce within a few years and settled for an average life. She mentioned how the woman wants to go back to China but cannot in order to “save face”. I thought this was shocking. I couldn’t understand how pride triumphs over happiness. However, in Chinese culture, bringing shame to your family and losing your dignity is one of the worst things one can possibly do. Hence, she will stay in America instead of going back home to China. I also learned about the importance of speaking with others to learn more about their backgrounds. Everyone has a story they are ready to share and Susan made me realize how important it is to ask. For example, she asked the right questions to learn more about how Vietnamese women came to America and how her life has changed. Learning about people’s backgrounds better helps us understand diversity and ultimately better incorporate it into our society. By listening to everyone’s story, you learn that everyone has had their fair share of struggles and you are not alone. This inspired me to ask my grandparents about their backgrounds and hardships.
