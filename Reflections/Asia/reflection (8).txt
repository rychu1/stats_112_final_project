In the class, Susan talked about the immigration experience of women coming to the US, especially emphasizing the Chinese women coming to the US. In her book, she described how Chinese women started their lives when they first came to the US. They spent numerous time adapting to US life and during that time, they had to fight with the cultural diversity, gender parity, and hard working environment. When she talked about Chinese immigration, the Japanese invasion of China brought together people of different political ideologies because everyone is affected. In the cultural revolution, most of the Chinese families were attacked. During that time, they stopped calling their father and mother and just called them antirevolutionaries. Most importantly, because of the language barrier, they suffered a lot. They could not speak or talk, all they could do was smile. Some of the immigrants found their life path and lived well, while some still struggled in the US and hoped to go back every minute.
