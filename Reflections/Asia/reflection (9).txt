I found Susan Phillips' presentation and related readings very interesting for the ways they raised questions of diversity and the importance of individual people's storytelling in influencing public opinion towards certain groups, in her case immigrant women. I found Xi Dan's story in particular very compelling, and a story that complicates dominant narratives of immigrant people as lazy and eager to benefit from and exploit the US's resources. To me, these individual women's accounts brought more of a human perspective to what statistics can oftentimes reduce to numbers. As Susan Phillips mentioned, it is very important, especially during political moments of heightened hysteria around immigration, that people be able to see and hear the stories of people who are actually impacted by immigration rhetoric and policy.
