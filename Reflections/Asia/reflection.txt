The talk with Susan Philips was a memorable experience. As an alien to this country, I could relate to many of the scenes she showed us in the movie clip. During the talk, I was surprised that there are people with various cultural backgrounds who are just as feeling alienated and excluded. Our class also had diversity in many respects. Some came from different countries and some came from different states. Some had special and strong relationship with their family. From the stories she told us, the story of Xiden, the Chinese immigrant, was the most relatable. I know many Koreans working in US devoting themselves into professional area completely different from the ones they had in Korea. Xiden was a dentist in China before coming to the states and she has become a cosmetician. She could not even dare to divorce because of her visa status. I could not relate more than her and the level of gravity towards this kind of topic felt that someone is actually caring about the minority.
