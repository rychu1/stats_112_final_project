Phillips discussed immigration of women coming to the United States. It was interesting to hear about the different stories the women shared about their experiences coming to the United States. In their home country, the women had technical and prestigious jobs but when they came to the states, the women had to work as waitresses or manicurists. This goes to show that these women had to start over and could not lead the professional lives they had in their home country in the United States. In addition, language was an obstacle these women faced when coming to America. Phillips’s talk enabled us to see how diverse America is with the different types of people who immigrate from different parts of the world. The talk also shed light by showing us immigrants are not able to hold a high position of employment when coming to the United States because they have to start over. All in all, Phillip’s lecture enabled the class to see the many types of cultures and ethnicities and how these women feel about immigrating to America.
