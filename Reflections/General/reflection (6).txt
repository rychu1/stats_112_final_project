From Susan’s talk I learn more about the diversity of different people’s backgrounds and how they grew up. She elaborated on people from Armenia, Vietnam, China, El Salvador and central Mexico. She also showed us a video about the people in her book talking about their stories. I am impressed by how different people from different origins all meet the same difficulties. Their cultures bring them various perspectives towards the world they are living in. It caught my attention and brought me to think about how people struggle to make a living in America. Suszan talks about how they all tried so hard to live and to be independent during the years of struggles. The social status decides that some immigrants have to face difficulties other people wouldn’t have to face or understand. All of them pursued the American dream and paid off during the process, too.
