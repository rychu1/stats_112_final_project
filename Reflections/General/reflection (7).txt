From the seminar with Susan Philips I have learned a lot about the hardships of immigrants. Many come from various backgrounds and they are looking for more opportunities that they may have been deprived of in the other country. Some come from war torn countries where the government is constantly changing but not in ways to benefit the country. They had to fight for survival and fear for their lives every day. They had to work many jobs just to get by and feed their families. Many would be sent to jail if they were against the government and were even treated worse than criminals. Immigrants were able to live freely as many come from cultures with strictly enforced laws and societal structures. The choice of immigrating can be hard for many because they leave behind old customs and their families in their beautiful countries. They also sacrifice a lot, including their culture. We also talked about whether there is an American culture. She also emphasized her opinion on Trump's way of going about immigration. She talked about how it was unlawful and equitable since immigrants are all over the countries’ legacy and were a big foundation of American society since they came from other countries and made it more diverse and they worked hard. The melting pot idea came into play. We talked about how American culture may be looked at as a place where different people and ideas mixed together. Also parents look at it as way less restrictive compared to their country when growing up. In American culture there is more freedom and tranquility for kids to have fun since they never lived through the hardships of war or other aspects of life that their parents come from. And a lot of laws are in place to ensure that freedom. However, there are still many downsides such as racism towards many cultures based on their ethnic backgrounds and their rising societal positions. This can lead to the psychological feeling of being singled out including discrimination.
