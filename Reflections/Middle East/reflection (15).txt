I was surprised by the level of devotion that her father and mother held toward the CCP movement by sacrificing more than fourteen hours a day for work. I am curious about the extent that people in China today know about the Cultural Revolution and how it split up many families. The immense belief in this ideology and fear of ostracization drove Xidan to prove her worth. I am interested to learn more about Xidan’s rejection of the traditional beliefs on marriage and if many others of her generation would agree with her. Although she mentions frequently her obligation to her country and being taught that there is no individualism, her actions and motivations to prove herself through her business also seem very individualistic. I was wondering how she reconciles those aspects of her life.
