I read Chapter 1 from Susan Philips’ book which was about an Armenian woman telling her family’s story of living in Armenia. I thought it was really interesting how she started the story with her grandparents and then worked her way down the family tree. It seemed as though, across the generations, their quality of life got better. However, despite the increased quality of life, family members from each generation still experienced discrimination for being Armenian. It was also heartbreaking to read the section where she outlined her dreams for a prosperous future in Armenia where they have a strong economy, people are living comfortably, and Armenians who left the country can return to their home. Having stability is something we often take for granted living in the U.S. and her description of such simple but perhaps hard to achieve dreams puts our privilege and luck in perspective. I would be curious to see what Susan Philips thinks about the future of immigrant women in the U.S.
