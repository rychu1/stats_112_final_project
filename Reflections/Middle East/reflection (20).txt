I read chapter 4 Susan Phillips’ book and I felt a personal connection with this reading. My mother is a Mexican immigrant from Jalisco, and the stories that Maria told remind me of the stories that she tells me about her life growing up. My grandmother was also a field worker, but I never knew enough Spanish to talk about her life with her before she passed. The first thing about the readings that surprised me was the nonchalant way in which she describes the deaths of her siblings. The way it is written makes it seem very monotone, which adds to the narrative of how hard this woman’s life was. The stories about her father going to the US all the time to send back money remind me of what my grandmother would do for my mother. She would go work in the fields of central California down to the bay, and she would send back money so that my mom and my tia could live. Her description of Mexican culture made me pretty sad because it doesn’t allow for women (or most men for that matter) to chase their professional dreams. Professional dreams aren’t valued as much as tradition and family though, and that’s something I wish was more common in the states. When she talks about loving the feeling of independence but yelling at her kids because they wanted to be more free than she was growing up, I snarled at the irony. Overall, I think this chapter provides an excellent illustration of a fairly privileged immigrant journey, the other stories that I’ve heard weren’t nearly as pleasant as the one she described.
