The chapter I read was about Nara and Oktiabrina and their experiences as Armenian refugees. One thing I found incredibly intriguing was how Nara said that communist families had “red baptisms” where they would give their children names such as Proletariat or Vladimir to show their dedication to the Bolshevik Revolution. Oktiabrina’s name means October, the month the revolution started. Despite the dedication of her family to the Communist Party, her grandfather was thrown into prison for being an accused Trotskyite and denounced the party after his release from incarceration. I found this to be a really interesting point throughout the reading because it shows how people are often enticed into blind devotion to a certain political party or ideology that does not exist to benefit them. This devotion can be seen today with President Trump as his supporters demonstrate a strong passion and loyalty to a leader that does not follow through on his promises for their betterment. Another thing I found shocking was the fact that the Armenian Genocide is constantly ignored and blatantly unaccepted by the government of Turkey, even after one and one-half million Armenians were killed. I personally did not know anything about the Armenian Genocide, or the injustices Armenians faced. I think the American education system selectively chooses which major historical events students are going to be taught and this leaves us with a very Westernized viewpoint that shows us the United States through rose- colored glasses, similar to what Nara said about her experiences in the Soviet Union. While the conditions in the United States are not nearly as extreme as those in the Soviet Union where Nara grew up, I think it is important to recognize similarities in our experiences as a way of reflection.
