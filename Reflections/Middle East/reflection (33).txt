My views on immigration did not really change after reading the book. I feel that there was an overall Understanding that even though there were a lot of trials and hardships that came with immigration but the opportunities in America made the journey worth it. I was surprised to learn that almost all of them had better professions that they spoke about with pride before immigrating to the United States. It was a little sad to hear about that since because their qualifications were from their country of emigration and the language barrier they were not able to hold the same job. I identified most with Nara because of the close relationship she shared with her mother, who came to stay with her after she immigrated. Although my grandparents did not immigrate with my parents, they often visit for long periods of time. This reflects the same multigenerational values found in many developing countries, where family support and togetherness across generations are deeply valued. I asked myself why the U.S. system makes it so difficult for immigrants with strong credentials to work in their trained fields. I also wondered how society can better support skilled immigrants in transitioning into roles that match their expertise. As a child of immigrant parents, I’ve learned how much strength and sacrifice go into building a new life in a different country. My parents’ journey from India to the U.S. taught me the value of perseverance, humility, and gratitude. I’ve come to understand that my identity can be a blend of two cultures.
