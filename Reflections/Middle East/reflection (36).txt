My views on immigration did not change much after reading the stores and having the discussion. I already had a strong belief that it is hard for many individuals to immigrate to the US and this discussion reinforced my opinions. What surprised me about the women in the book is how much different everyone’s backgrounds were. Some were much older than the others and had progressed into their dream careers while others were just getting started. I felt that the broad range of perspectives allowed for each story to feel unique and show the differences of people who are immigrating. I identified with Mara because I understand her struggle in going to a place that is much different than where she grew up and had a career in. Transferring from a community college to a university was a hard adaptation for me as well and I empathize with her feelings of being lost and trying to fit in. Some of the questions I asked myself were: How do immigrants make an impact in the US? How do people of different ages adapt to a new culture? These questions were partially answered. I learned that immigrants play a huge role in filling job positions and expanding their culture to different areas.
