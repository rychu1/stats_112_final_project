An interesting theme that continues to pop up in the story of Maria Luisa Onody is education. The first mention of school is in the paragraph about her grandmother, who would say she had a pizarrón (blackboard) in her home. This ties in later when María says that she loved school, but her mother never encouraged her to go further than elementary school. This is clearly indicative of the role that women had generally played in rural Mexican life. This theme of difficulty through education continues throughout her whole life like when she graduates from Escuela Normal, a stark contrast from what her academic life could have looked like if she completed her studies in the United States. Questions: How have cultural ties either inhibited or helped your academic endeavors in the past? What, in your opinion, are the biggest changes in attitudes towards women in education recently?
