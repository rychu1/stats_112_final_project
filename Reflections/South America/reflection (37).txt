Yes, my view towards immigrants and immigration in general became a lot more empathetic. I know my parents immigrated, and I’ve learned a lot about their struggles, but with this many perspectives, the book taught me how that struggle can be different across backgrounds and how It brings meaning to being an immigrant. Each person in the book makes countless emotional sacrifices, and the writing shines a light on the numerous unseen sacrifices that have been made by so many others. I was surprised by the woman’s resilience and their perseverance despite facing legal setbacks, language barriers, and rejection. It was clear how many of them struggled with internal conflict, feeling gratitude and resentment for where they came from. I most identified with the woman from El Salvador because of her attempts at maintaining cultural ties for her children while adapting to a new society. My own parents struggled with this as well, choosing to incorporate certain cultural and religious values over others, as they knew I would be integrating into American culture as well. I asked: what is a way we can honor immigrants and their contributions or adversity without reducing them to victims? Another question I asked was: how does advocacy in the modern-day cater to immigrants and their stories, and what does it need to tackle it most optimally? Tentatively, I’m not really sure what the answer to the second question is, but I do know that a means to honor them and listen to them is by writing about their stories in the manner that Susan Philips did. Her book humanizes immigrants and the struggle they experience, which can be a crucial building block in the advocacy of immigrant rights. I’m not an immigrant myself, but my parents immigrated to the United States in 2001. Their arrival in the US taught me how to balance two cultures, two languages, and two different backgrounds, but I think I’ve learned to cherish my backgrounds independently and gather meaning from them separately.
