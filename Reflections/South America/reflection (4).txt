To begin, the talk with Susan Philips was very well organized and thought-out. I appreciate that Susan drove an hour to get to UCLA to talk to our class. I also appreciate that she spoke to us considering that one of her close acquaintances passed away. When she showed the video about the different diverse women who left their home country and migrated to the United States in order to have a better life, I was very intrigued. Not only did she show the video, but she also provided us with an update in regards to women’s lives now. I was surprised to learn that one of the women developed cancer and it makes me wonder if it was due to the type of work that she did. In addition, I was pleased to learn that the daughter of the woman who migrated from Guatemala graduated from USC and became a teacher. Susan Philips also brought the class closer by asking students about their parent’s experiences and what the class considered “American” culture to be. Many students said that they considered America to have a culture, but it was more like a “tossed salad.” This reference was made because the United States was built on immigrants, so that is why there is not one thing that particularly belongs to the “American” people. Although, one student, who was of Indian descent, mentioned that he grew up in the East Coast and he knew that he was different from his white American peers. Even though I do understand what he is saying, I feel that each wave of immigration had its own impact in the United States.
